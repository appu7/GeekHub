Passport is a Node.js middleware that offers a variety of different request authentication strategies that are easy to
implement. By default, it stores the user object in session.

JSON Web Tokens is an authentication standard that works by assigning and passing around an encrypted token in requests
that helps to identify the logged in user, instead of storing the user in a session on the server and creating
a cookie. It has different integrations including a Node.js module.
